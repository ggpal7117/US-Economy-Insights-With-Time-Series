# US-Economy-Insights-With-Time-Series
In this project, we will be utilizing the Federal Reserve Economic Data API to scrape, analyze, and forecast data regarding key aspects of the American economy, ranging from Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment. This project consists of two parts, Exploratory Data Analysis, aswell as time series forecasting which uses Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) models.


# Gross Domestic Product
Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important economic indicators for how a country's economy is doing. It shows a comprehensive measure of economic activities and is a monetary measure of the total market value of goods and services every quarter. From the late 1940s to the late 1970s, growth was consistent but relatively slow. In the 1980's however, GDP started growing at a pace faster than ever, which would continue. Often known as the "Reagan Boom," this growth started with massive tax cuts, deregulations, aswell as a growing tech industry. Also, globalization slowly grew, expanding the scales of many companies. After the large 2020 "Covid dip", the GDP recovered quickly at great rates due to the reopening of businesses and jobs, stimulus checks, and pent-up demand. The percent change in GDP in recent quarters has been going down due to slower productivity from the post-covid boom, and tariffs and trade tensions from the Trump Administration.


# Consumer Price Index and Inflation

CPI and Inflation are two terms that are similar but different. CPI is an essential factor for determining inflation rates, but is more specifically defined as the level of prices of goods and services commonly bought by households. Countries with higher CPIs may have to pay more for key goods and services, whereas countries with lower CPIs pay less. Inflation, on the other hand, is defined as the rate at which goods and services increase. GDP and CPI tend to be very correlated with one another, so the CPI graphs are very similar to the GDP graphs. After the mid-1970s, CPI started growing very fast. This is due to oil embargos, higher wages and unions, and wars. Inflation rates were at nearly 6% in the mid-1970s due to OPEC's embargo and poor management of interest rates. The early 1980s recession then led to the highest inflation in American history at over 6% from the prior period due to the early 1980s recession. The most recent spike in inflation was post-COVID covid where the government spent trillions of dollars on stimulus, aswell as bottlenecks and delays in supply chains.

## Housing
The median price of a home has increased from $ 20,000 in the 1960s to over $ 400,000. The large increase in recent years is primarily due to supply issues, where demand for housing exceeds the available supply.
The rate at which housing prices changed has been relatively similar to the inflation rate aswell.

# Income and Spending
It this section we looked at Personal Disposable Income(PDI), Personal Consumer Expenditures(PCE), aswell as income and wages between demographic groups.

## PCE vs PDI
Do people make more than they spend. From just these two metrics, yes. Generally over time, PDI and PCE has both increased with people currently having a disposable income of over $20000. However, PCE has increased at the same rate. THe gap between the graphs indicate money left for savings and non-immediate purchases.
Note: Both metrics are not adjusted for inflation, which means the data simply reflects the median raw dollar amount during these years. Also, there are many other metrics that need to be taken into account to show if people are truly making more then the median Personal Consumer Expenditure rate.

## Weekly Income for College Graduates and Non College Graduates.
Moving on, to answer the commonly asked question, do college grads make more money. The answer is yes as seen from the graph display weekly pre tax and deduction incomes for both groups over time. This shows that higher education can equate to higher chance of financial stability, however, prices of tuition have increased by over 60% since 2000, meaning many college grads come out of college with debt(average of $27000) which can take longer to pay off.

## Minimum Wage
